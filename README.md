Learning to code at Makers Academy. Previously at Beryl, +6 years growing the startup from the ground up to become one of London's most exciting urban mobility ventures. Vast project management experience, working with cross functional teams in a dynamic and constantly evolving environment. Looking for an impactful and inspiring new challenge.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

Leadership in ideation, business strategy and system implementation. Confident at adapting processes within constantly evolving environments to maximise efficiency.
**Formation of internal R&D programme:** Taking inspiration from the latest software development techniques used short sprints to investigate new technologies and solutions to product issues; including mapping of user stories and extensive market research.
**Product failure reduction:** A first victory for the R&D programme was the identification of a new waterproofing gasket design following a string of failures and subsequent rollout of this modification to significantly reduce failure rate of the product by almost 50%.

#### Project Management

Experienced in agile methodologies and delivering to tight deadlines. Strong communication skills, well versed at acting as the bridge between technical teams and management / customers.
**Successful launch on Kickstarter:** Straight off the mark, delivered to an extremely punchy schedule, the launch of the Laserlight, Beryl’s first consumer product. Raising £55k in 30 days as one of first UK Kickstarter campaigns. Included rapid formation of the brand, the very important pitch video and the critical generation of proof of concept prototypes.
**Initial set up of supply chain:** Built the initial relationships with designers, manufacturers and logistic services. Acted as a key link between the founders and wider team/customers. Enabling the rollout of laserlight technology across all 12,000 Santander Cycles in London, a significant milestone for the company.
